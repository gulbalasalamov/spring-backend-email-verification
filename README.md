## Spring Backend Email Verification 
This project is the full implementation of Spring Boot framework with given dependencies:
- Lombok --> Java annotation library which helps to reduce boilerplate code.
- Spring Web --> Builds web, including RESTful, applications using Spring MVC
- Spring Security --> Highly customizable authentication and access-control framework for Spring applications.
- Spring Data JPA --> Persists data in SQL stores with Java Persistence API using Spring Data and Hibernate
- PostgreSQL Driver --> JDBC & R2DBC driver allowing Java programs to connect to PostgreSQL database using standart Java code
- JavaMail Sender --> Send email using Java Mail and Spring Framework's JavaMailSender.

## Project Description

The purpose of this app is to build an entire backend system. People that wants to be system user go through series of registration process and 
once they verify their given email, then they become the application user with the role of user. 

The project aims to:

- leverage spring security with secure endpoints, 
- create app user with some roles, 
- implement user registration with controllers and service, 
- generate verification links that expires after 15 minutes,
- store data in database, and
- send emails .

Most of the business logic for practice purpose and hence can be improved.
